## Email 1: One Tree Planted (Trees üå≥)

**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: Climate Gifting Platform - Bulk Tree Planting

**To:** partnerships@onetreeplanted.org

---

Hi One Tree Planted Team,

My name is [Your Name] and I'm the founder of **Gifted Air** (https://gifted-air.vercel.app), a new platform that transforms climate action into emotional gifts.

**What We Do:**
We enable people to send symbolic climate gifts to loved ones‚Äîinstead of traditional presents, users can "gift" tree planting, ocean cleanup, clean water access, and more. Each gift comes with a personalized message and creates real environmental impact.

**Why We're Reaching Out:**
We're looking to establish a formal partnership with One Tree Planted to ensure every tree gift on our platform funds actual tree planting through your verified projects.

**Current Volume:**
- Just launched (soft launch phase)
- Currently processing tree gifts at $1 each
- Expecting 100-500 trees/month initially
- Projecting 1,000+ trees/month within 6 months

**Partnership Proposal:**
1. **Monthly Bulk Donations:** We would make monthly bulk donations based on total tree gifts sent
2. **Impact Verification:** Provide our users with certificates or impact reports showing real trees planted
3. **Co-Marketing:** Feature One Tree Planted as our verified partner on our website and in emails
4. **Transparent Pricing:** We're transparent that $0.50 of each $1 gift goes directly to tree planting (after payment processing fees)

**What We Need:**
- Confirmation that our monthly donations will fund actual tree planting
- Any impact reports or certificates we can share with our users
- Bulk pricing information (we understand $1/tree is standard)
- Logo and partnership materials for our website

**Our Commitment:**
Complete transparency with our users about where funds go, and monthly donations regardless of volume. We're building this for long-term impact, not short-term profit.

Would love to discuss how we can work together to turn emotional gifts into forests!

Best regards,

## Email 2: The Ocean Cleanup (Ocean Plastic üåä)

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Climate Gifts Supporting Ocean Cleanup

**To:** partnerships@theoceancleanup.com

---

Hi Ocean Cleanup Team,

I'm [Your Name], founder of **Gifted Air**, a platform that lets people send climate action as gifts to friends and family.

**Our Mission:**
We're making environmental impact personal and emotional. Instead of sending flowers or cards, people send "ocean cleanup" gifts, "tree planting" gifts, and more‚Äîeach with a heartfelt message.

**How It Works:**
- User selects "Ocean Cleanup" gift ($2)
- Adds personalized message for recipient
- Recipient receives beautiful digital gift card
- We fund real ocean plastic removal through verified partners

**Partnership Proposal:**
We'd like to partner with The Ocean Cleanup to ensure every ocean gift directly supports your mission:

- **Monthly Donations:** Based on total ocean cleanup gifts sent
- **Current Volume:** Starting with $100-$500/month, scaling to $1,000+/month
- **Impact Tracking:** Share your impact data with our users
- **Co-Branding:** Feature The Ocean Cleanup prominently on our platform

**Transparency:**
We're upfront with users that ~50% of each gift goes to actual cleanup after payment processing fees. We believe transparency builds trust.

**Why Partner With Us:**
- **New Audience:** Reach people who want to give meaningful gifts
- **Recurring Donors:** Users send multiple gifts over time
- **Emotional Connection:** Gifts create deeper engagement than one-time donations
- **Growth Trajectory:** Aiming for 1,000+ gifts/month within a year

**Next Steps:**
Would you be open to a quick call to discuss how we can work together? We're committed to making monthly donations starting immediately, even before a formal partnership.

Looking forward to cleaning the oceans together!

Best,

## Email 3: Charity: Water (Clean Water üíß)

**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: Gifted Air x Charity: Water

**To:** partnerships@charitywater.org

---

Dear Charity: Water Team,

I'm reaching out to explore a partnership between **Gifted Air** and Charity: Water.

**About Gifted Air:**
We're a platform that turns climate and humanitarian action into gifts. Instead of buying something that adds clutter, people can send "clean water access" gifts to loved ones, funding real water projects in developing nations.

**Our Vision:**
Make giving personal and emotional. A birthday gift that provides clean water to 3 people is more meaningful than another Amazon package.

**How You Fit In:**
Charity: Water's 100% model and transparency align perfectly with our values. We want to ensure every clean water gift ($3) on our platform directly funds your projects.

**Proposed Partnership:**
- **Monthly Donations:** Bulk monthly donations for all water gifts sent
- **Impact Certificates:** Provide our users with Charity: Water impact reports
- **100% Transparency:** We openly show users exactly where funds go
- **Co-Marketing:** Feature Charity: Water as our verified water partner

**Starting Volume:**
- Soft launch: $200-$500/month
- 6-month goal: $1,500+/month
- 1-year goal: $5,000+/month

**Our Differentiator:**
We're not a donation platform‚Äîwe're a **gifting** platform. This creates emotional connections that drive recurring giving and word-of-mouth growth.

**Immediate Action:**
We're ready to start monthly donations now, even before formal partnership agreements. We believe in Charity: Water's mission and want to support it regardless.

Could we schedule a brief call to discuss partnership possibilities?

Thank you for bringing clean water to millions. Let's bring more people into this mission through the power of gifts.

Warmly,  
[Your Name]

## Email 4: World Wildlife Fund (Wildlife Conservation ü¶Å)

**Subject:** New Partnership Opportunity: Climate Gifts for Wildlife

**To:** partnerships@wwf.org

---

Hello WWF Partnerships Team,

My name is [Your Name] and I've built **Gifted Air**, a platform that transforms conservation into meaningful gifts between people.

**The Concept:**
Instead of traditional gifts, users send symbolic "wildlife conservation" gifts ($8) to friends and family, with each gift funding real conservation work through organizations like WWF.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Broader Reach:** Attract people who wouldn't typically visit WWF.org
- **Emotional Hook:** Gifts create personal connections to conservation
- **Recurring Revenue:** Birthday gifts, anniversaries, apologies‚Äîregular occasions
- **Younger Audience:** Appeal to millennials/Gen Z who prefer experiences over stuff

**Partnership Proposal:**
We'd like to establish a formal relationship where:

1. **Monthly Funding:** We make bulk monthly donations for all wildlife gifts sent
2. **Impact Tracking:** WWF provides impact data we can share with users
3. **Verification:** Feature WWF as our verified wildlife conservation partner
4. **Co-Branding:** Use WWF logo and materials (with permission)

**Pricing Transparency:**
Each $8 wildlife gift breaks down as:
- ~$2.64 to payment processing
- ~$4.00 to WWF (50%)
- ~$1.36 to platform operations and growth

We're transparent about this with users because honesty builds trust.

**Current Status:**
- Platform is live: https://gifted-air.vercel.app
- Early traction: 20-50 gifts/week
- Growth plan: 500+ gifts/week by Q4 2025

**Unique Value:**
Most people won't donate $8 to conservation. But they WILL spend $8 on a meaningful gift for a friend. We're expanding the pie, not competing for existing donors.

**Next Steps:**
I'd love to discuss how we can formalize this partnership. We're committed to making monthly donations starting now, with or without formal paperwork.

Can we schedule a quick 15-minute call?

Thank you for your incredible conservation work. Let's bring more people into this mission.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

## Email 5: Coral Restoration Foundation (Coral Reefs ü™∏)

**Subject:** Partnership: Gifted Air Supporting Coral Restoration

**To:** info@coralrestoration.org

---

Hi Coral Restoration Foundation,

I'm [Your Name], founder of **Gifted Air**, and I'm reaching out about a potential partnership.

**What We're Building:**
A platform where people send climate action as gifts. Instead of flowers for a birthday, send a "coral reef restoration" gift that funds real coral planting.

**Why Coral Restoration Foundation:**
Your hands-on approach and measurable impact (coral fragments, nurseries, genetic diversity) align perfectly with what our users want to support.

**The Partnership:**
- **Gift Option:** $5 "Coral Reef Restoration" gifts on our platform
- **Monthly Donations:** We pool all coral gifts and donate monthly
- **Impact Stories:** Share your coral updates with our gift senders
- **Transparency:** We show users exactly how funds are allocated

**Volume Expectations:**
- Starting: 20-50 coral gifts/month ($100-$250)
- 6 months: 200+ coral gifts/month ($1,000+)
- 1 year: 500+ coral gifts/month ($2,500+)

**What Makes Us Different:**
We're not competing with your donation page. We're reaching people who wouldn't typically donate to coral restoration but WILL send it as a meaningful gift to someone they love.

**Immediate Action:**
We're ready to start donating now. Even without formal partnership, we'll make monthly donations to support your work. Partnership just makes it official and allows us to tell our users about the amazing work you do.

**Request:**
- Permission to feature Coral Restoration Foundation as our coral partner
- Any impact data/photos we can share with gift senders
- Logo for our website
- Optional: Brief call to discuss collaboration

Your work is incredible. Let's bring more people into coral restoration through the power of heartfelt gifts.

Thank you,  
[Your Name]
