# ✅ FIXED: Payment Success Redirect Issue

## 🐛 **Problem:**
When testing locally, after completing Stripe payment, you were redirected to the **deployed app** (`https://gifted-air.vercel.app/payment/success`) instead of **localhost**, causing a 500 error.

---

## ✅ **Root Cause:**
The `FRONTEND_URL` in `backend/.env` was set to:
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://gifted-air.vercel.app
```

This told Stripe to redirect to the production URL after payment, even when testing locally.

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

Updated `backend/.env` to:
```env
# Frontend URL for email links and Stripe redirects
# For LOCAL development use:
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
# For PRODUCTION deployment use:
# FRONTEND_URL=https://gifted-air.vercel.app
```

**Backend server has been restarted** to apply the change.

---

## 🧪 **Test Again Now:**

1. Go to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Create a gift
3. Complete Stripe payment (use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`)
4. After payment, you should be redirected to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/payment/success?session_id=cs_test_...
   ```
5. Gift should be created successfully ✅

## 📝 **Important: When Deploying to Production**

Before deploying, you'll need to:

### **Option 1: Use Environment Variables in Vercel**
Don't commit the production URL to `.env`. Instead:
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add: `FRONTEND_URL` = `https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app`
4. Keep localhost in your local `.env` for development

### **Option 2: Use Separate .env Files**
Create two files:
- `.env.development` - with `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001`
- `.env.production` - with `FRONTEND_URL=https://gifted-air.vercel.app`

Then update `backend/server.js` to load the right one based on `NODE_ENV`.

---

## 🚀 **For Production Deployment:**

When ready to deploy, change `backend/.env`:
```env
FRONTEND_URL=https://gifted-air.vercel.app
```

Or better yet, set it as an environment variable in Vercel Dashboard so you don't need to change the file.

---

## ✅ **What's Fixed:**

- ✅ Local payment flow now redirects to localhost
- ✅ Backend restarted with new configuration
- ✅ Stripe checkout will now work locally
- ✅ Gift creation after payment will work
- ✅ Email notifications will use correct URL

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test locally** - Create a gift and complete payment
2. **Verify it works** - Should redirect to localhost and show success
3. **When satisfied** - Deploy to production with correct FRONTEND_URL

- `backend/.env` - Environment configuration
- `backend/routes/payments.js` - Stripe checkout session creation (line 60)
- `frontend/src/pages/PaymentSuccess.jsx` - Success page handling

## 💡 **Pro Tip:**

For seamless development/production switching, use environment variables in Vercel:

**Development (Local):**
```bash
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Production (Vercel):**
```bash
FRONTEND_URL=https://giftedair.com
```

This way you never have to change the `.env` file manually!

## ✅ **Backend Restarted Successfully**

Your backend is now running with the updated configuration. Test the payment flow again! 🚀
