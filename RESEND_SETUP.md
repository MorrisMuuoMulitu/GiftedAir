That's it! No sender verification needed! ðŸŽ‰

### **Step 3: Update .env**

**Local Backend (.env):**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5174
```

**Note:** Use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing - it works immediately!

### **Step 4: Add to Render (Production)**

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click your backend service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add these THREE variables:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
FRONTEND_URL=https://gifted-air.vercel.app
```

5. Click **"Save Changes"**

2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Add your domain
4. Add DNS records (they show you exactly what)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "Email not sent" in logs
- Check API key is in `.env`
- Make sure it starts with `re_`

### "Invalid API key"
- Regenerate API key in Resend dashboard
- Make sure you copied the full key

### Emails in spam
- Normal for `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Set up custom domain to improve deliverability
