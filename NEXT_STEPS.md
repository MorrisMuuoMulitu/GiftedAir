## 🎯 MARKETING STRATEGIES

### **Social Media Posts**

#### **Twitter/X Launch Post:**
```
Just launched Gifted Air 🌍

Turn pocket change into planet change:
🌳 $1 = Tree planting
🌊 $2 = Ocean cleanup  
💧 $3 = Clean water
...up to $10 for solar power

Send climate action as a gift. 
100% transparent on where money goes.

Try it: [your-url]

#ClimateAction #SustainableGifts
```

#### **LinkedIn Personal Story:**
```
I built something I'm really proud of 💚

For months, I've struggled with gift-giving. Another Amazon package? 
Another thing that'll end up in a landfill?

So I built Gifted Air - a platform where you can send climate action 
as gifts. Plant a tree for someone's birthday. Clean the ocean for 
an anniversary. Provide clean water as a thank you.

Starting at just $1.

The twist? We're 100% transparent about where every dollar goes. 
50% to verified climate partners. 33% to payment processing. 
17% to keep the platform running.

This isn't charity—it's gifting with impact.

Check it out: [your-url]

Would love your feedback! 🌍

#### **Instagram Caption:**

🎁 What if gifts could heal the planet?

Introducing @giftedair - climate action you can gift 💚

Instead of stuff that adds clutter:
• Plant trees for birthdays 🌳
• Clean oceans for anniversaries 🌊
• Provide clean water for thank yous 💧

Prices: $1-$10
Impact: Priceless

Title: I built a platform to send climate action as gifts ($1-$10)

Hey r/climateaction!

I struggled with gift-giving. Everything felt wasteful. So I built 
Gifted Air - you can send climate action as gifts instead of stuff.

🌳 Plant a tree: $1
🌊 Clean the ocean: $2
💧 Provide clean water: $3
...up to $10 for solar power

What makes it different:
• 100% transparent (show exactly where money goes)
• Partnering with verified orgs (One Tree Planted, etc.)
• Beautiful gift cards with personal messages
• No greenwashing - honest about fees

Soft launched last week. Would love your feedback!

(Mods: Hope this is okay - genuinely seeking community input, not just promoting)

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATES

### **To Friends/Family:**

**Subject:** I built something - need your honest feedback 🌍

---

Hey [Name]!

I've been working on a side project and would love your thoughts.

It's called **Gifted Air** - basically, you can send climate action as 
gifts instead of physical stuff.

Like:
- Plant a tree for someone's birthday ($1)
- Clean the ocean for an anniversary ($2)
- Provide clean water as a thank you ($3)

Each gift comes with a personalized message and creates real 
environmental impact through verified partners.

I built it because I'm tired of giving/receiving stuff that ends up 
in a drawer. Thought there might be a better way.

Would you try it? Even if it's just $1 to test. Your feedback would 
mean everything.

Here's the link: [your-url]

(PS - I'm being 100% transparent about where money goes. You can see 
the full breakdown at [your-url]/transparency)

Thanks!  
[Your Name]
